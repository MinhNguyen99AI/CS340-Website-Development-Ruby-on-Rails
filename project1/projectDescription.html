	Project 1

	Notes on our projects:
	- To make the website responsive, we make so that the page will change <br>	if the width of the window is smaller than 1260px 
	- We designed the logo ( Lambonini ) ourselves. 
	- All other images are from google.
	- Texts in the About Us section are copy pasted from a random site.
	- Ending texts under Phone Number, and before "Learn More" are copy pasted <br>	from the Paypal Website.
	- The Google Maps we added was based on the Google guide on how to add google maps to websites. 
	Thank you !
